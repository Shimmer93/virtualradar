# Virtual Radar - Real-Time Millimeter-Wave Radar Sensor Simulation for Perception-driven Robotics

`ViRa` is a real-time FMCW radar simulation frameworks aimed for robotic applications. The framework allows simulation of FMCW radar sensors with different configuration parameters in different scenarios. 

Main features: 

* Generation of radar **raw data** in real-time
* Fully customizable radar parameters
* Modelling of multi-antenna systems
* Modelling of wave penetration effects of non-conductive objects
* Modelling of antenna radiation patterns for beamforming

A paper describing `ViRa` and it's features in detail has been accepted for the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal. A short video showing `ViRa` in action can be found on our Youtube channel.
