The framework allows simulation of FMCW radar sensors with different configuration parameters in different scenarios embedded in the Unity3D game engine environment. 

## Main features

* Generation of radar **raw data** in real-time
* Fully customizable radar parameters
* Modelling of multi-antenna systems
* Modelling of wave penetration effects of non-conductive objects
* Modelling of antenna radiation patterns for beamforming

A [paper](link-to-paper) describing ViRa has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L). 
A [video](link-to-video) showcasing the frameworks capabilities in different scenarios can be found on our Youtube channel.

**NOTE:** We are continuosly working to improve and expand the ViRa framework. For most recent news, please refer to our [news section](link-to-news)
