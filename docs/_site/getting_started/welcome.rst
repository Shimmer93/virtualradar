What is ViRa?
==================

ViRa is a real-time millimeter-wave radar sensor simulation framework built over the Unity3D engine. The goal of ViRa is to provide a realistic simulation platform of radar sensors for reasearchers in the field of robotics. A key feature of ViRa is the generation of raw data signals such that researchers can apply, investigate or develop new algorithms for solving complex tasks in robotics. Possible applications of ViRa are in the field of navigation or human-robot interaction.

Motivation
==============



ViRa features
==================

1. Generation of radar raw data in real-time
2. Fully customizable radar parameters
3. Modelling of multi-antenna systems and antenna radiation patterns for beamforming
4. Modelling of wave penetration effects of non-conductive objects
5. Embedding in a game environment which also allows coupling with other frameworks and engines.
6. This project is open-source. Anyone is welcome to contribute!



Our contribution
================

To the best of our knowledge, ViRa is the first real-time millimeter-wave radar simulator embedded in the Unity3D game engine environment for providing realistic radar raw data in real-time.
