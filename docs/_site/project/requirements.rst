First of all and before installation, you will need to statisfy some hardware and software prerequisites:

1. **Software**:
	For the development of ViRa we used 64-bit Windows 10 OS. ViRa was not tested on Linux or MacOS. Software requirements are the following:

	1.1 **Visual Studio**. In order to compile UnrealROX and Unreal Engine you will need Visual Studio. For this purpose you need to install Visual Studio 2017 with the configuration file we provide (put link). In the Visual Studio Installer you can import a VS configuration file and all required individual packages and workloads will be automatically installed. This is important in order to avoid some errors when compiling UnrealROX software or different versions of Unreal Engine.

2. **Hardware**:

	2.1. **GPU**. Make sure your GPU driver is well installed and updated. You need a good GPU to run smoothly a scene alongside ViRa system. 

	2.2 **Overall hardware requirements**. For a smooth experience in photorealistic virtual environments rendered by Unreal Engine we recommend a good performance hardware configuration. 

3. **You are now ready to install ViRa, import your photorrealistic scene and create your own awesome dataset!**
